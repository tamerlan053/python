# Exercise 4

# A random integer is generated between 1 and 10 (inclusive), and the user is allowed to try to guess it.
# The computer provides feedback: "higher," "lower," or "congratulations, number guessed." 
# Use a function to provide the feedback. The player can only guess 4 times! 
# The game stops if the number is guessed or if the 4 attempts are over.
