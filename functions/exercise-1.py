# Exercise 1

# A bank clerk wants to quickly calculate the value of a certain amount in euros in US dollars. 
# At the beginning of the program, he enters the value of the euro against the US dollar, for example, 1 euro = 1.072 US dollars (1.072 is entered). 
# Subsequently, amounts in euros are entered, after which the value in US dollars is displayed. 
# The conversion takes place via a function. The program ends when 0 is entered for the amount in euros.
