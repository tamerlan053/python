# Exercise 9

# Via the keyboard, two integers \( a \) and \( b \) and an operation code are entered. The operation code offers the following options:
#  -Code 1: Addition (\( a + b \))
#  -Code 2: Subtraction (\( a - b \))
#  -Code 3: Multiplication (\( a \times b \))
#  -Code 4: Square of \( a \)
#  -Code 5: Square of \( b \)

# The goal is to perform the operation specified by the code on the entered numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and print the result along with the entered numbers. If a code is entered that does not correspond to one of the above operation codes, the message "Invalid code" should be printed.
